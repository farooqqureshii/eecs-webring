# üï∏Ô∏è A [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring#:~:text=A%20webring%20(or%20web%20ring,theme%2C%20often%20educational%20or%20social.)) for [EECS](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science) students @ uOttawa

This project is inspired by the amazing webrings @ The University of Waterloo ([se-webring.xyz](https://se-webring.xyz/), [ece.engineering](https://ece.engineering/)) and McGill University ([mcgilcswebring.org](https://mcgillcswebring.org/)) üöÄ

**Have a look at the uOttawa EECCS Webring [here](https://farooqqureshi.com/eecs-webring/)!**

### ‚å®Ô∏è A note on the domain
The domain at the momment is attatched to my website (farooqqureshi.com/eecs-webring). I don't plan to keep it like this, and intend to get a nice domain once enough users add themselves in. 

### ‚úÖ Some general information
- Personal websites are great (or portfolios). Social networking pages (eg: LinkedIn, X) are not suitable for teh webring.
- To be part of the webring - you must be a student at the University of Ottawa (or be an alumni), and you must be (or must have been) studying a program under the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science).
